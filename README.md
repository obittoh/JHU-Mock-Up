# JHU-Mock-Up

First thing first, this a project done following a psd file. The .psd is included in this project. 
Personally, I used Studio Visual Code as my editor for this project. To get all the neccesary files required to run this project, either
clone this github repo or download the zip on your computer. After that, extrac the zip and click on the index.html file.


Note: To open the psd file you must have photoshop or GIMP ( for liinux users) installed. Each layer contains specific formatting for the project.

Enjoy.
